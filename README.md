# Example automated time tracking app


A demo app to demonstrate a technique to track window activity and idle time on a Windows computer

## Opening and compiling the app

You will need a recent copy of RAD Studio or Delphi. You can download a trial or the free CE version here: [www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi)


## This app accompanies a webinar
I wrote this for an episode of our Embarcadero "30 for 30" series.  You can catch the webinar replay via the link below.

The video shows the app in use and explains how I did it.
